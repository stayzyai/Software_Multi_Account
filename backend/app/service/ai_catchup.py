UNANSWERED MESSAGES TO ANALYZE:
{json.dumps(recent_messages, indent=2)}

ALL UNANSWERED MESSAGES (for context):

TASK: Analyze if these unanswered messages need a response. Consider:

1. Are the recent messages just trying to get attention? (e.g., "Hello?", "Are you there?")
2. Is there an underlying question or issue that still needs addressing?
3. Has the guest already resolved their issue or moved on?
4. Is the matter time-sensitive or still relevant?

RESPOND WITH ONE OF:
- "RESPOND_WITH_CONTEXT" - If you should respond and address both the attention-seeking messages AND the underlying issue
- "RESPOND_SIMPLE" - If you should respond but only to acknowledge the recent messages
- "NO_RESPONSE" - If no response is needed (issue resolved, too old, etc.)

If responding, also provide the type of issue to address (e.g., "early_checkin", "wifi_issue", "general_inquiry").
